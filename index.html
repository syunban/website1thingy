      <h1>Effect of Submerged Fluid Particulate Concentration on UV Radiation Saturation Rates Analyzed Thorough Differential Models</h1>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>This study investigates the relationship between suspension concentration and the degree of ultraviolet radiation mitigation. The experiment documented UV saturation levels in UV detecting beads submerged in suspensions of 0, .00281, .00560 and .00838 percent dirt by volume. Dirt was collected at environmental density and composition obtained from the New Hyde Park region. Higher concentrations of dirt were directly correlated to a decrease in penetrative UV radiation concentration, ultimately resulting in an increased time for the UV detecting beads to reach a maximum state of maximum saturation. These results supported a novel model representing this relationship, which may be applied to make more accurate predictions research in various areas, including environmental research evaluating the extent of UV radiationâ€™s presence and influence on aqueous ecosystems. The methodology employed by this experiment is simple to replicate, allowing for less expensive and more efficient analysis of UV exposure profiles in suspensions and their adjacent systems. The application of this model and experimental procedure may facilitate further research in river and swamp environments, where high-precision UV detection technology may not be applicable or efficient.</p>
